# Neural Networks Overview

## Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the human brain's neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. ANNs can be used for tasks like pattern recognition, classification, regression, and clustering.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specialized neural networks for processing grid-like data, such as images. They use convolutional layers to automatically learn hierarchical patterns in the data, making them highly effective for image recognition and computer vision tasks.

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed to work with sequence data, where the current output depends on the previous ones. RNNs have a "memory" that allows them to process sequences of inputs, making them suitable for tasks like speech recognition, language modeling, and time series prediction.

## AlexNet

AlexNet is a deep CNN architecture that won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2012. It popularized the use of deep CNNs for image classification tasks, demonstrating the power of deep learning in computer vision.

## VGG16 and VGG19

VGG16 and VGG19 are deep CNN architectures developed by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford. They are known for their simplicity and effectiveness. VGG16 has 16 layers, and VGG19 has 19 layers, consisting mainly of convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers.
